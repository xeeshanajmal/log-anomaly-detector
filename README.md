# 🔍 ShodanGPT: AI-Augmented Threat Intelligence from the Internet

> Discover, analyze, and understand exposed devices online using Shodan + GPT-4

---

## 📌 Overview

**ShodanGPT** combines the power of [Shodan.io](https://www.shodan.io/) — the search engine for Internet-connected devices — with **OpenAI’s GPT-4** to automatically:

- Search for exposed services and devices online  
- Interpret risk levels from banners and metadata  
- Explain vulnerabilities in natural language  
- Recommend mitigation strategies for security teams  

This project bridges the gap between **raw OSINT data** and **actionable threat intelligence** — ideal for cybersecurity analysts, AI security researchers, and red teams.
